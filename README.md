# Create a Google Drive clone with MongoDB, Express, NodeJS, and React.

In this guided learning tutorial we are going to make a **Google Drive clone** using ReactJS. We will be also using **firebase** to store the files and for authentication.

We will be using **styled components** to style our project. 

We need to first create a new project with create-react-app called google drive from terminal.

## Create New Project

`npx create-react-app google-drive`

After the project is created, we will delete some of the boiler plate files.
